# 12-bit-SAR-ADC-Front-End-VLSI-Design


**Abstract:**
     This paper outlines the design and execution of a 
12-bit Successive Approximation Register (SAR) 
Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) that employs low-power 
dynamic double-tail comparators. The main aim of this design 
is to deliver high-resolution performance while minimizing 
power consumption, which is essential for applications with 
energy constraints, such as portable and battery-operated 
devices. The proposed SAR ADC capitalizes on the benefits of 
dynamic double-tail comparators, which facilitate lower power 
dissipation during the decision-making process, all while 
ensuring the necessary speed and accuracy for achieving 12-bit 
resolution. We present a comprehensive design of the 
comparator architecture, the SAR control logic, and the overall 
output of the ADC. Simulation results validate the design's 
capability to operate with accuracy. The design is realized in a 
180nm CMOS process, and the outcomes indicate promising 
performance metrics, rendering it suitable for applications 
requiring high resolution and low power consumption.
